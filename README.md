# TextEditor and Counter Application
This React-based web application provides an interactive user experience with key functionalities such as a counter, a user data form, and a rich text editor. Built using modern UI libraries like Material UI, Chakra UI, or Next UI, it ensures smooth interactions, visually appealing components, and persistent data storage.
## Features
1. Counter Component: Increment, decrement, and reset with dynamic background color transitions (Bezier curve).
2. User Data Form: Collects user details, auto-generates a unique ID, stores data locally (Local Storage/RTK), and warns of unsaved changes.
3. Rich Text Editor: Displays user data with formatting (bold, italic, underline, lists) and ensures data persistence.
4. Dashboard: Visualizes user trends and counter stats using React Charts for interactive insights.
